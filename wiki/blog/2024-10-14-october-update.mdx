Before I start, a note about the title.  Somehow I started these post out of step where I am calling it the current month but give the update on the previous.  Let me stop doing that and make a bit more sense.  From here out the updates will include everything that has happened from the previous post to the current one.

September brought us a ton of behind the scenes changes.  Work was mainly done on the timers, alarms and reminders automation which is now in beta testing.  This automation is huge (~500 lines of code) and complicated but it works and has been given good reviews from the testers.  We hope to have this released soon but some work still needs to be done to tidy things up and to reuse this code for other automations.  Hint:  "play the sound machine for an hour"

In addition, the [thermostat control](https://dinki.github.io/View-Assist/docs/extend-functionality/sentences/thermostat-control) automation and video was released.  Now we're living in comfort!!

One of the biggest advances was the new wiki which was finally put in place.  Thanks again to @theonecubed for getting this set propped up.  We now have a much better way to present the View Assist documentation.  Not only that, this makes it much easier for users to contribute by making edits to the wiki.  Now everyone can contribute even if it is just fixing gramatical errors or making things easier to understand.

Also in huge news, we now have a [community contributions](https://dinki.github.io/View-Assist/docs/community-contributions) section.  This will be user submission and user supported blueprints, scripts, views and tips and hints that extend View Assist even further.  These are things that don't fit in the core but provide specialized functionality.  You will love it!  Thanks to Flight-Lab/flab for the first contribution!

On the social front, we continue to increase our Youtube subscribers and recently crossed over the 400 subscriber mark!  Our Discord server has continued to flourish with everyone helping each other.  The level of interaction and work being done on this project has exceeded expectation month over month.  You guys are fantastic!
