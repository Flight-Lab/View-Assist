View Assist is easily extendable by adding custom views which receive data from custom sentences. On this page you will find a gallery of premade custom views. You will find links to the sample image, requirements and other useful information.

We encourage everyone to share their creations so that others might enjoy what you have brought to life.  These user submitted views can be found in the [Community Contribution](../../community-contributions/index.md) section of the wiki.
