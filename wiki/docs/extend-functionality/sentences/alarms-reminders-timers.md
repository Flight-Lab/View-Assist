# Alarms Reminders & Timers

### Description

This custom sentence allows for an on demand call to create and list alarms, reminders and timers. While this intial version is fully functional, I do not take any responsibility if this makes you late for work, forget to buy your wife flowers, or if your eggs get overcooked. There's your warning and my escape clause!

### Usage

Use your wakeword and say things like:

- Set a timer for 2 minutes
- Start an egg time for 3 minutes
- List my timers
- Remind me to wash the dog at 3pm
- Set a reminder to take the food out of the over in 30 minutes
- Cancel my egg timer
- Set an alarm for 4pm

### Requirements

- **View**: [Alarm view](../views/alarm)

### Installation

- Find and upload a sound to play when the timer expires. Need help? See the Stream Assist video where I discuss how to find these and where to upload
- Install blueprint using button above and configure options
