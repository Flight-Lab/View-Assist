Note that this video was recorded before the integration existed so you can skip the blueprint and view install as those are now automatically provided for you

User can search for general knowledge questions on people, places, things, etc on Wikipedia. This custom sentence blueprint requires that Pyscript be installed (Watch the [Install video](https://youtu.be/jpJxZaisbGQ)). Download the file ['viewassist-wikisearch.py'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dinki/View-Assist/refs/heads/main/View_Assist_custom_sentences/Search_Wikipedia/viewassist-wikisearch.py) and place it in your Home Assistant configuration directory in the 'pyscript' subdirectory.

You will also need the [info](../views/info) and [infopic](../views/info) views installed.

Special thanks to Scratt for his work on this automation
