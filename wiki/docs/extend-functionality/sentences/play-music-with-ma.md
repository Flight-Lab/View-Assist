## Requirements

- View: [Music view](../views/music)
- The recently added musicplayer_device must be added to your View Assistant device configuration as explained in the [Satellite Custom Device Configuration](https://github.com/dinki/View-Assist/wiki/View-Assist-device-configuration#satellite-custom-device-configuration) portion of the wiki.
