View Assist is easily extendable by adding custom sentences which provide data to different custom views. On this page you will find a gallery of premade custom sentences provided by our community members. Contained here are custom sentence automations and scripts that do not fit the core of View Assist.  This may be due to the reliance on certain integrations, hardware or conditions that do not make it a fit for core but still provides functionality for those who can apply.  You will find links to the requirements and installation instructions. Blueprints have been made available for easy installation. 

We encourage everyone to share their creations so that others might enjoy what you have brought to life.
