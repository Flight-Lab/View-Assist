View Assist is easily extendable by adding custom views which receive data from custom sentences. On this page you will find a gallery of premade custom views provided by community members. These are the views that are used by the [community contributions custom sentences](../cc-sentences/index.md) or provide additional functionality to the View Assist dashboard.  You will find links to the requirements and installation instructions.

All views can be added using the [instructions found here](../../viewassist-setup/homeassistant-configuration/viewassist-configuration/dashboard-views/views.md)

We encourage everyone to share their creations so that others might enjoy what you have brought to life.
