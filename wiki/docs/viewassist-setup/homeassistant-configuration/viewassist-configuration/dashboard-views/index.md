# Dashboard & Views

:::info
Note that this entire section is only necessary if using View Assist with video enabled satellites.  It is not necessary to install these for voice only satellites.
:::

The core View Assist dashboard is configured to use a base custom button card templates.  This dashboard is the framework for the views.  The template also sets common default variables like time and temperature which are used on different views.  This allows for code reduction and consistency.  Data display views are then created.  These are much smaller than the dashboard template views as they leverage this framework.  The simplicity in these views should make it less intimidating for others to create and share their custom views.
