# View-Assist

View Assist provides visual feedback for the Home Assistant Assist voice assistant using a collection of different automations, custom sentences, scripts, and extensions with the view being displayed on any Android device.  Multiple devices can join the View Assist satellite network and interact.  This is not limited to Android devices as ESPHome satellites are also supported.  The project is still a work in progress but is fully functional.

The information in this repo is separated into different subdirectories with install information stored in the wiki.  This project is designed so that you can pick and choose the parts that you want for your needs.  The custom sentences can be modified for those who may only be interested in voice only.  The dashboard views may be interesting to others who are writing their own custom sentences.

UDPATE:  I've been made aware of a really cool device and I've been working on getting it to work with View Assist.  The Lenovo Thinksmart device is a nice Android tablet with a nice sounding speaker at an unbelievably low price (~$40 USD). [https://amzn.to/3POGKW3](https://amzn.to/4bRBnhk)
